# AI Sign Language Project

## Overview
This project aims to recognize and translate sign languages using a CNN or RNN model (LSTM). It leverages TensorFlow, Mediapipe, and NLP for feature extraction, model training, and text correction.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/godinezsteven1/AI-SignLanguage.git
cd AI-SignLanguage
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv fai_project_env
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- **For macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source fai_project_env/bin/activate
  ```
- **For Windows:**
  ```bash
  fai_project_env\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Setup
To make sure everything is working, try running a basic script, such as `hand_tracking.py`, to ensure TensorFlow and Mediapipe are installed correctly.

```bash
python hand_tracking.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a window showing hand tracking in real time.

## Running the Project
Once you’ve set up the environment, you can start working on the project by running the appropriate scripts:
- `hand_tracking.py`: For hand tracking and feature extraction.
- Other scripts for data preparation, model training, and NLP integration will be added as development progresses.

## Notes
- Make sure to **always activate the virtual environment** before running the project.
- If you encounter issues with the camera on macOS, go to **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > **Camera** and grant access to your terminal/VS Code.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests for improvements, bug fixes, or new features!

### **Git Ignore**
We’ve included a `.gitignore` file to ensure we don't track unnecessary files such as the virtual environment or large dataset files. Please don’t commit changes to these ignored files.
